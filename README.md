# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data ahead of 2020 US Elections
A sentiment analysis project performed on data collected from Twitter mentioning the two primary contestants in the 2020 US Elections. The data for this project was collected using Twitter's publicly available tweepy api, a week before the elections are scheduled to be held (on 3rd November 2020).

The project uses VADER Sentiment Analysis algorithm to judge the sentiment of the tweets made on either primary contestants. Based on the intensity of the different sentiments involved in the tweet, we judge the overall sentiment of the tweet. We group such sentiments together to find out the overall sentiment of a particular state towards a particular candidate in order to figure out whether the state is going to be a red one or a blue one.

The overall success of this analysis will be found out only after the election results are declared.
