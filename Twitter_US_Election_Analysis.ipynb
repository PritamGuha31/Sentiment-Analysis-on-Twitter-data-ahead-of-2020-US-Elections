        "\n",
        "1. **The distribution of the data is poor.** I pointed this out earlier during my analysis and I feel that this may have included some bias in my analysis. Ideally, we should have same number of tweets for all states for both candidates. But in the real world, this is difficult to achieve if not impossible. However, an area of improvement is including some distribution models to get my dataset towards an uniform distribution of states.\n",
        "2. **The location identification part of the analysis needs improvement.** As discussed earlier, ideally the location of the tweet can be fed to the Google Maps API to get the state from where the tweet was made if it is from the United States.\n",
        "3. **The prediction of the judgement for a state can be improved.** The logic which I used for predicting the overall judgement of a state whether Democratic or Republican can be improved. I used my limited technical knowledge and nous on this domain to make a logic for this calculation but this is open to further suggestions and improvements.\n",
